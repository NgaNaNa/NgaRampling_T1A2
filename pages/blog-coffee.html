                        <p class="single-blog-blurb">A light-filled, white wall space that transforms this Collingwood cafe/roastery known as Acoffee into a daily art exhibit of caffeine. Although a destination for a coffee dine in or take away, their real focus sits within roasting. Sourced and then roasted on location you can enjoy your choice of ‘white, black, or pour-over coffee’ as the aromas of the daily roasted coffee swirl the cafe. Beans are available in-store as well as online monthly subscriptions that plant freshly roasted small batch coffee right to your door.</p>

                        <h4 class="blog-weights-h4-title">Monk Bodhi Dharma - Balaclava</h4>
                        <p class="single-blog-blurb">One of the true innovators in Melbourne’s speciality coffee scene is Monk Bodhi Dharma, brainchild of Marwin Shaw, Monk started its claim to Melbourne’s caffeine mantle with its single store off Carlisle Street Balaclava. Focusing on ethically sourcing coffee and a sustainably friendly menu, Monk works closely with its farmers and suppliers. Monk has transformed over the years creating their own roasting network with Disciple Roasters, the self-described ‘Coffee Hustlers’ sling their beans to their three different caffeine outposts across Melbourne with Bayano The Rebel, a hole in the wall cafe and refuge off Chapel Street in South Yarra, and Admiral Cheng-Ho, infamous for its six coffee grinder setup which sits on at the entrance to Collingwood on Johnston Street. All three locations are worthy of inclusion and stand as individual contenders for Melbourne’s best coffee.</p>

                        <h4 class="blog-weights-h4-title">Proud Mary - Collingwood</h4>    
                        <p class="single-blog-blurb">A stalwart of Melbourne coffee culture, Collingwood’s Proud Mary make a mean brew with coffee that’s roasted in their factory just down the road. There’s a stack of varietals to choose from, and they’re worth exploring should you be including Proud Mary in your morning ritual—their rotating takeaway sanga menu is also up there as one of the best.</p>
