                            But that doesn't mean you should skip the weight room.

                            Lifting weights has some surprising perks that you can't get from cardio alone. Research shows that just two strength-training sessions a week can help you burn more fat, sculpt lean muscles, feel more energized, and so much more.

                            Here are eight reasons you should start lifting today. Before starting this or any new exercise regimen, though, make sure you consult your doctor.

                        <h4 class="blog-weights-h4-title">1. You’ll Burn More Calories</h4>
                        <p class="single-blog-blurb">If you lift heavy weights and increase your muscle mass, you'll burn more calories at everything you do.
                            Although cardio burns more calories than strength training during your 30-minute sweat session, lifting weights burns more overall. It all goes back to building muscle. It takes more energy (calories) for your body to maintain muscle cells than it does fat cells. So by lifting weights to add more muscle mass, you'll boost your metabolism and turn your body into a more efficient fat-burning machine.</p>

                        <h4 class="blog-weights-h4-title">2. You’ll Maintain Muscle</h4>
                        <p class="single-blog-blurb">Research shows that between the ages of 30 and 70, women lose an average of 22 percent of their total muscle. What's even more upsetting is that over time, the muscle void is often filled with fat. One pound of fat takes up 18 percent more space than one pound of muscle, so even if the number on the scale goes down, your pants size might go up.
                        
                        The best way to stay tightly packed?
                        
                        Keep strength training! For best results, Tom Holland, MS, CSCS, author of Beat the Gym, recommends two to three total-body strength workouts per week for 30 minutes each session. Include three to four days of cardiovascular exercise, either on the same days or alternate days.</p>

                        <h4 class="blog-weights-h4-title">3. You’ll Build Stronger Bones</h4>    
                        <p class="single-blog-blurb">Lifting weights can be your best defense against osteoporosis — a disease affecting 10 million Americans, 80 percent of which are women, according to the National Osteoporosis Foundation. "When you lift weights, you engage muscles that pull on the tendons which, in turn, pull on the bones," says Holland. "This added stress makes bones stronger."</p>
