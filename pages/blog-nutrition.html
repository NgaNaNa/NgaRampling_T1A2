                        <p class="single-blog-blurb">A balanced eating pattern is a cornerstone of health. Women, like men, should enjoy a variety of healthful foods from all of the foods groups, including whole grains, fruits, vegetables, healthy fats, low-fat or fat-free dairy and lean protein. But women also have special nutrient needs, and, during each stage of a woman's life, these needs change.</p>

                        <h4 class="blog-weights-h4-title">Iron-rich Foods</h4>
                        <p class="single-blog-blurb">Iron is important to good health, but the amount needed is different depending on a womanâ€™s stage of life. For example, iron needs are higher during pregnancy and lower after reaching menopause. Foods that provide iron include red meat, chicken, turkey, pork, fish, kale, spinach, beans, lentils and some fortified ready-to-eat cereals. Plant-based sources of iron are more easily absorbed by your body when eaten with vitamin C-rich foods. To get both these nutrients at the same meal, try fortified cereal with strawberries on top, spinach salad with mandarin orange slices or add tomatoes to lentil soup.</p>

                        <h4 class="blog-weights-h4-title">Daily Calcium and Vitamin D Requirements</h4>
                        <p class="single-blog-blurb">For healthy bones and teeth, women need to eat a variety of calcium-rich foods every day. Calcium keeps bones strong and helps to reduce the risk for osteoporosis, a bone disease in which the bones become weak and break easily. Some calcium-rich foods include low-fat or fat-free milk, yogurt and cheese, sardines, tofu (if made with calcium sulfate), tempeh, bok choy, soy beans, sesame seeds, green leafy vegetables  and calcium-fortified foods and beverages, such as plant-based milk alternatives, juices and cereals. Adequate amounts of vitamin D also are important, and the need for both calcium and vitamin D increases as women get older. Good sources of vitamin D include fatty fish, such as salmon, eggs and fortified foods and beverages, like milk, as well as some plant-based milk alternatives, yogurts and juices.</p>

                        <h4 class="blog-weights-h4-title">Balancing Calories with Activity</h4>    
                        <p class="single-blog-blurb">Since women typically have less muscle, more body fat and are smaller than men, they need fewer calories to maintain a healthy body weight and activity level. Women who are more physically active may require more calories.

                            Physical activity is an important part of a woman's health. Regular physical activity helps with muscle strength, balance, flexibility and stress management.</p>
