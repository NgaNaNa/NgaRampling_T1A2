                            My kids and I have reviewed hundreds of playgrounds all over Melbourne and now I present – my curated list of Melbourne's best playgrounds. It was hard to stick to just a small number of playgrounds so I tried to avoid listing two playgrounds in the same suburb.

                        <h4 class="blog-weights-h4-title">1. ArtPlay Playground, Melbourne</h4>
                        <p class="single-blog-blurb">This playground is a regular CBD pit-stop due to it's convenient location. It's right next to ArtPlay and Fed Square, and really is one of the best playground Melbourne CBD.

                            There is play equipment built around a central boardwalk with a number of slides, a rope climbing structure, swings and a sandpit.</p>

                        <h4 class="blog-weights-h4-title">2. Ron Barassi Snr Park, Docklands</h4>
                        <p class="single-blog-blurb">Ron Barassi Snr Park is on the north bank of Docklands and the site includes a sports field, pavilion, walking circuit and playground.
                            The Docklands playground includes a large climbing tower, tyre swing, sandpit and several water pumps.  While playing, there is a lot to see with views of Melbourne Star, Bolte and Westgate bridges and usually at least a few cranes in the Docklands.

                        <h4 class="blog-weights-h4-title">3. Harmony Garden, Point Park, Docklands</h4>    
                        <p class="single-blog-blurb">On the south bank of Docklands is an excellent park for kids called Harmony Garden built by Point Park's developers Mirvac in collaboration with Simon Ellis Landscape Architects and artists Neil McLachlan and Emilia Storm.
                            The playground is set out with different play spaces, including nature play, water play and musical instruments. It’s surrounded by native plants and blossom trees, giving the space an appealing natural aesthetic. In my book, this is one of the top playgrounds Melbourne has ever seen.
