## Portfolio Website Description

This is a website built for an assessment requirement from Coder Academy, Bootcamp Flex Track 2, 2021. A Portfolio website to showcase and promote myself as an aspire Web Developer student.

### Purpose

The self-built website will allow potential employer to get a field of who I am and where I am located. Also importantly, the skills and knowledge I have by navigating the website that I have put together after 5 weeks into the course.

### Functionality / features

This website has been implemented with responsive design in mind. Making it responsive to three major devices: Mobile, Tablet and desktop.<br>
The mark-up language is HTML and CSS for styling.<br>
It has a navigation bar, allowing a user friendly experience.<br>
The images and other resource contents have had SRI encryption so that the user can be confident that any downloaded data will not have malicious data injected in there by a third party.<br>
It is public and available to anyone who wants to view it through the internet, as it has been deployed via Netlify.<br>
Each update made to this project should be pushed to my GitHub repository account. In doing so, modifying or updating this website can be done anywhere, and anytime, provided I have a desktop device with internet service available.<br>
